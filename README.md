## Principals of a high quality code

- **KISS**: keep It Simple, Stupid! The solutions must be the more simple as it could be.
- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It! Do not anticipate code that you don't use now.
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat your self! Avoid duplicate code.
- **TDA**: Tell, Don't Ask! We do not change a attribute/data of a class B from a class A. Instead, the class A must tell to the class B to deal with her own data.

- **LoD**: Law of Demeter. We don't want to work with the "friend of my friend". I mean, if a class A needs class B, and class B needs class C, the class A do not need to know about class C.

- **SOLID principals**

- **Express the intention**: the name of variables, function, methods ans tests gave a hint about intention.

- **Design Patterns**

- **GRASP**: General Responsibility Assignment Software Principals.
